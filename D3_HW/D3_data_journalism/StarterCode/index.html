          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <h1>Poverty Rates vs Obesity Percentage</h1>
          <p>The data shows the states with a greater percentage of the population in poverty also have a higher
             percent of obesity. Families in poverty may lack proper health insurance which could lead to less doctor visit
             to help with underlying conditions like diabieties, high blood pressure, and metabolism irregularities. Also, 
             it possible that families in poverty might not have the resources (i.e. a car to use to grocery shop) to eat healthy and exercise properly. 
             My recommendation is to suport these communities by providing more parks/rec areas and education on how eat healthy on a budget. 
          </p>

          <h1> Median Age vs Obesity Percentage</h1>
          <p>The data suggests that states with a lower median age have a lower rate of obesity amongst the states population. 
            This can be simply explain by the fact that younger people have a better metabolism rate than older folks. My recommendation
            for states with higher median age population is to education their ciizens in maintaining an active lifestyle even as they get older.
          </p>

          <h1> Median Household Income vs Obesity Percentage </h1>
          <p>This is similar to the Poverty Rates and Obesity Rates. Families that are strapped for cash for every day items will try to 
            take the easiest and cheapest route to fulfill their basic needs such as food. These families may not have access to doctors and dietians 
            who are available to families with higher household incomes. States with lower household incomes should provide an education program to teach 
            the community about the benefits of healthy eating and constant activity.
